# Full-Stack-User-Registration-System-on-AWS-EC2-RDS-Route-53-
This project involves developing and deploying a dynamic web application using AWS EC2, RDS, and Route 53. The website allows users to register and log in, with all user data securely stored in an Amazon RDS MySQL database. The application is hosted on an EC2 instance and connected to a custom Route 53 domain for public access.
